# Modern UI Migration Continuation Guide

## Purpose

Use this document as the prompt guide for continuing the Mediflow modern UI migration later. It records where the work stopped, what has already been completed, and the exact order to follow until the full system is migrated.

## Installation Configuration Update

Super admin Installation Setup is available at `/admin/installation`. See [INSTALLATION_SETUP.md](INSTALLATION_SETUP.md) for package configuration, system branding, welcome-page templates, account provisioning, route enforcement, and tests.

## Current Stop Point

Phase 8 billing, finance, and reports are complete. Continue with the final cleanup phase for remaining legacy/fallback screens.

### Asset Build

Node/NPM was not available in the current shell, so `npm run build` could not be verified.

Until the real Vite build is generated, `layouts.modern` uses:

- `public/css/modern-fallback.css`
- existing built `resources/js/app.js`

When Node/NPM is available, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then confirm `public/build/manifest.json` contains:

- `resources/css/modern.css`
- `resources/js/modern.js`

### Layout Rule

Only migrated screens should use:

```blade
@extends('layouts.modern')
```

or:

```php
#[Layout('layouts.modern')]
```

Unmigrated screens should remain on:

- `layouts.app`
- `layouts.live`

### Livewire Metadata Rule

Every migrated Livewire component should pass:

```php
'pageTitle' => 'Screen Name',
'pageSubtitle' => 'Short screen purpose.',
```

The view should use:

```blade
<x-ui.page :title="$pageTitle" :subtitle="$pageSubtitle">
    ...
</x-ui.page>
```

### Controller View Metadata Rule

Every migrated Blade controller view should include:

```blade
@section('title', 'Screen Name')
@section('page-title', 'Screen Name')
@section('page-subtitle', 'Short screen purpose.')
```

and wrap the content with:

```blade
<x-ui.page title="Screen Name" subtitle="Short screen purpose.">
    ...
</x-ui.page>
```

## Standard Verification For Every Migration Slice

Run:

```bash
php -l path/to/changed/php/file.php
php artisan view:cache
php artisan route:list --name=target.route.prefix --except-vendor
php artisan view:clear
```

If a migrated screen uses a controller view, test:

- index route
- create route
- edit route with an existing record
- show route if available
- POST/PUT/DELETE action paths if safe in the local environment

If a migrated screen uses Livewire, test:

- component mounts successfully
- filters update
- buttons fire the expected Livewire action
- validation errors display correctly
- toast events still display

## Do Not Forget

- Keep old layouts until all screens are migrated.
- Keep module licensing and user module access as the sidebar authority.
- Do not add hardcoded sidebar links.
- Avoid broad backend refactors during UI migration.
- Update this document after each completed module.
- Update `docs/UI_PHASE_2_ADMIN_CORE.md` while Phase 2 is active.
